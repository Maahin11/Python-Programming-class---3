# Python While Loop Examples

This Jupyter Notebook contains various examples demonstrating the use of `while` loops in Python. Each example illustrates different use cases, including summation, iteration, conditional checks, and list manipulation.

## Examples Included

1. **Summation from 1 to 50**:
   - A `while` loop is used to calculate the cumulative sum of numbers from 1 to 50.
   - The result is printed at each step.

2. **Print Numbers from 15 to 30**:
   - A simple `while` loop prints numbers from 15 to 30.

3. **Summation from 50 to 100**:
   - This example calculates the cumulative sum of numbers from 50 to 100 using a `while` loop.
   - The result is printed at each step.

4. **Print Even Numbers from 1 to 20**:
   - A `while` loop is used to iterate through numbers from 1 to 20, printing only the even numbers.

5. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - The user inputs a number, and the program calculates its factorial using a `while` loop.

6. **Sum of Digits**:
   - The user inputs a number, and the program calculates the sum of its digits using a `while` loop.

7. **List Manipulation**:
   - Various examples of list manipulation using `while` loops, including:
     - Accessing and modifying list elements.
     - Reversing a list.
     - Finding the maximum value in a list.

8. **Infinite Loop with Break and Continue**:
   - Examples of using `break` and `continue` statements within an infinite `while` loop to control the flow of execution.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab).
   - Run each cell sequentially to see the output of each example.

2. **Modify and Experiment**:
   - Feel free to modify the code in each cell to experiment with different inputs and conditions.
   - For example, change the range of numbers or the conditions in the loops to see how the output changes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment (e.g., Google Colab)
